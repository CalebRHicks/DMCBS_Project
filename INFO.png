-changes made to dmcbcs.f90 (search "Galea"):
added option to start from random configurations as opposed to lattice sites
changed orbital call in coshpot.f90
added option for 2d units E_FG=E_F/2
updated rungekutta.f90 (marked changes with !2d)

-Makefile is set up for sharcnet

-note: to run proper 2D simulations we have found the Jastrow table size to be important (see file "coshpot2d.f90")
